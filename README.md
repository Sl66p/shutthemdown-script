# Shut them down!

#### Shut them down is a script used on win 10 / win 11 machines to simply shut them down.
#### This script is non malicious, and a very simple script if youre newer with HIDM Devices :)
#### Feel free to download and edit this script.

## Suggestions 

#### You could change the command at the end of the script to something along the lines of
### " STRING shutown /s "
#### This will then display a message saying "this system will shut down in one minute.
#### and no matter if you close the window or not, the system will shut down.
